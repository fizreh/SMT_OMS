During the backend development phase, I iterated on the project structure multiple times to improve modularity, layering, and long-term maintainability. While restructuring the repository, I encountered a version-control issue that resulted in the loss of the original remote repository history, including branches and merged pull requests related to backend development. To address this cleanly, I recreated the repository with an improved and more stable project structure and continued development from there. Although the original commit and PR history for the backend is no longer visible online, I have documented the technical challenges, architectural decisions, and solutions implemented during that phase, and the backend code itself reflects this work (domain modeling, repository pattern, logging, authentication, Dockerization, etc.). The frontend work, which followed this restructuring, retains full branch and commit history in the new repository. This experience reinforced my understanding of repository hygiene, branching strategies, and the importance of stabilizing structure early in a project.
